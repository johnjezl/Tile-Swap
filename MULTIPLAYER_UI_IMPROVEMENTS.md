# Multiplayer UI Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Tile Visibility Control

**Problem:** In multiplayer mode, players could see the tile assignments immediately in the lobby, which could allow some players to plan their strategy before the game officially starts, creating an unfair advantage.

**Solution:** Tiles are now hidden until the game starts for ALL players (including the host).

**Implementation:**
- Added `showTiles` flag to `TileSwapGame` class ([game.js:346](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\static\game.js#L346))
- Modified `drawNodes()` to check `showTiles` flag before rendering tiles ([game.js:882-907](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\static\game.js#L882-L907))
- Updated multiplayer client to control tile visibility based on game state

### 2. Graph Preview in Lobby

**Feature:** Players can now see the graph structure (nodes and edges) while waiting in the lobby, but without tile assignments.

**Visual Design:**
- Nodes appear in neutral gray color (`#555` in dark mode, `#999` in light mode)
- Only node numbers are shown (centered in each node)
- Node edges are visible to show the graph connectivity
- No tile numbers are displayed until game starts

**How it works:**
- When host creates room: Graph is generated, tiles hidden ([multiplayer.js:112-113](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\static\multiplayer.js#L112-L113))
- When player joins room: Graph preview loaded without tiles ([multiplayer.js:193](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\static\multiplayer.js#L193))
- When game starts: Tiles revealed for all players simultaneously ([multiplayer.js:217-241](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\static\multiplayer.js#L217-L241))

### 3. Enhanced Tile Display

**Problem:** Tile numbers looked plain and weren't visually distinct from node numbers.

**Solution:** Tile numbers now appear as little square "tiles" with borders.

**Visual Design:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Node Circle   │
│                 │
│   "Node 2"      │  ← Small text at top
│                 │
│   ┌────────┐    │
│   │   3    │    │  ← White square "tile" with border
│   └────────┘    │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Specifications:**
- Tile size: 28x28 pixels
- Background: White (`#fff`)
- Border: Dark gray (`#333`), 2px width
- Number: Bold 18px Arial, dark gray (`#333`)
- Positioned below node label

### 4. Increased Node Size

**Change:** Node radius increased from 30 to 40 pixels ([game.js:336](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\static\game.js#L336))

**Reason:** Larger nodes provide:
- Better visibility of the tile display
- More room for the "little tile" design
- Easier clicking/selection on touch devices
- Better visual hierarchy

### 5. State Management

**Single Player Mode:**
- `showTiles = true` (always visible)
- Tiles shown immediately after graph generation
- No changes to existing behavior

**Multiplayer Mode:**

**Lobby Phase:**
- `showTiles = false`
- Graph structure visible
- Node numbers visible
- Tiles hidden

**Playing Phase:**
- `showTiles = true`
- All tiles revealed simultaneously when host clicks "Start Game"
- Fair competition starts

**Mode Switching:**
- Switching to single player automatically enables `showTiles` ([multiplayer.js:84-86](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\static\multiplayer.js#L84-L86))
- Ensures seamless transition between modes

## Files Modified

### 1. `static/game.js`
- Line 336: Increased `nodeRadius` from 30 to 40
- Line 346: Added `showTiles` flag (default `true`)
- Lines 830-909: Rewrote `drawNodes()` method to support preview mode

**Key changes in `drawNodes()`:**
```javascript
// Different node colors based on mode
if (this.showTiles && tileInfo.matched) {
    this.ctx.fillStyle = '#4CAF50';  // Green when matched
} else if (this.showTiles) {
    this.ctx.fillStyle = '#2196F3';  // Blue when playing
} else {
    this.ctx.fillStyle = isDark ? '#555' : '#999';  // Gray in preview
}

// Conditional rendering
if (this.showTiles) {
    // Draw node label + tile square
} else {
    // Draw only node number (preview mode)
}
```

### 2. `static/multiplayer.js`
- Line 84-86: Re-enable tiles when switching to single player
- Lines 112-113: Hide tiles when host creates room
- Lines 180-194: Load graph preview when joining room
- Lines 217-241: Show tiles when game starts
- Lines 396-445: Enhanced `loadMultiplayerGraph()` with tile control

**Key logic flow:**
```javascript
createRoom()      → showTiles = false
joinRoom()        → loadMultiplayerGraph(roomInfo, false)
gameStarted()     → showTiles = true  OR  loadMultiplayerGraph(roomInfo, true)
switchToSingle()  → showTiles = true
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Host Experience
1. Create a multiplayer room
2. **Verify:** Graph shows gray nodes with numbers only (no tiles)
3. Wait for another player to join
4. Click "Ready"
5. Click "Start Game"
6. **Verify:** Tiles appear as white squares with numbers

### Test 2: Joining Player Experience
1. Join an existing room
2. **Verify:** Graph preview shows (gray nodes, no tiles)
3. Click "Ready"
4. Wait for host to start
5. **Verify:** Tiles appear simultaneously with host

### Test 3: Tile Synchronization
1. Open two browsers (use incognito for second)
2. Create room in browser 1
3. Join room in browser 2
4. **Verify:** Both see same gray graph preview
5. Host starts game
6. **Verify:** Both see identical tile arrangements at same time
7. **Verify:** Tile numbers appear as white squares with borders

### Test 4: Mode Switching
1. Create multiplayer room
2. **Verify:** Tiles hidden
3. Switch to "Single Player" tab
4. Click "New Random Game"
5. **Verify:** Tiles visible immediately
6. Switch back to "Multiplayer" tab
7. **Verify:** Returns to normal multiplayer behavior

### Test 5: Visual Design
1. Start any game
2. **Verify:** Node radius is larger (40px)
3. **Verify:** Tile numbers appear in white squares
4. **Verify:** Squares have dark borders
5. **Verify:** Node labels appear above tiles
6. Test dark mode
7. **Verify:** All elements visible in both themes

## Benefits

### Fairness
- All players see tiles at exactly the same time
- No planning advantage during lobby phase
- True simultaneous start for competitive play

### User Experience
- Graph preview helps players understand the puzzle structure
- Larger nodes easier to click
- Tile design clearly distinguishes tile numbers from node numbers
- Visual anticipation builds excitement before game starts

### Educational Value
- Students can analyze graph connectivity before tiles appear
- Focus on algorithmic thinking rather than quick reactions
- Better suited for algorithm analysis class project

## Backward Compatibility

- Single player mode completely unchanged
- Existing save files still work
- All keyboard shortcuts still functional
- No breaking changes to API

## Known Limitations

- Preview mode only available in multiplayer
- Single player always shows tiles immediately (as designed)
- Graph editor not affected by these changes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Customizable Preview Time:** Allow host to set a preview period (e.g., 30 seconds of graph preview before tiles reveal)
2. **Tile Reveal Animation:** Smooth fade-in or flip animation when tiles appear
3. **Different Tile Styles:** Let users choose tile appearance (squares, circles, hexagons)
4. **Color-Coded Tiles:** Optional color scheme for tiles based on their values

**Status:** ✅ Complete and ready for testing

**Testing Priority:** High - Critical for fair multiplayer gameplay
