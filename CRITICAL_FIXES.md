# Critical Fixes - UI & Broadcasting

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Name Input Box Styling

**Problem:** Input box had purple background and was hard to read, shifted too far to the right.

**Fix:** [style.css:727-761](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\static\style.css#L727-L761)

**Changes:**
- Removed purple background (was using `var(--section-bg)`)
- Set explicit white background for light mode
- Set dark background for dark mode
- Removed padding from container (was causing right shift)
- Set transparent background for container

**Before:**
```css
.name-change-section {
    padding: 10px;              /* Caused right shift */
    background: var(--section-bg); /* Purple background */
}

.name-change-section input {
    background: var(--bg-color);   /* Variable (purple) */
    color: var(--text-color);
}
```

**After:**
```css
.name-change-section {
    padding: 0;                 /* No shift */
    background: transparent;    /* No background */
}

.name-change-section input {
    background: #ffffff;        /* White in light mode */
    color: #333;               /* Dark text */
}

body.dark-mode .name-change-section input {
    background: #2a2a3e;        /* Dark in dark mode */
    color: #ffffff;            /* Light text */
}
```

### 2. Player Number Preservation

**Problem:** When players changed names, they lost their player number (e.g., "Player 2" became just "Alice").

**Fix:** Names now show as "Player 2: Alice" to maintain identification.

**Implementation:**

**Player Dataclass ([multiplayer.py:36](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\multiplayer.py#L36)):**
```python
player_number: int = 0  # For display purposes (Player 1, Player 2, etc.)
```

**Assign Number on Join ([multiplayer.py:80-86](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\multiplayer.py#L80-L86)):**
```python
# Assign player number based on current count
player_number = len(self.players) + 1
self.players[session_id] = Player(
    session_id=session_id,
    name=name,
    player_number=player_number
)
```

**Preserve Number on Change ([multiplayer.py:107-114](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\multiplayer.py#L107-L114)):**
```python
def change_player_name(self, session_id: str, new_name: str) -> bool:
    """Change a player's name, keeping the player number prefix."""
    if session_id in self.players and new_name.strip():
        player = self.players[session_id]
        # Keep the player number, update the custom name
        self.players[session_id].name = f'Player {player.player_number}: {new_name.strip()}'
        return True
    return False
```

**Examples:**
- Auto-named → "Player 2"
- After changing to "Alice" → "Player 2: Alice"
- After changing to "Bob" → "Player 2: Bob"
- Host can say: "Hey Player 2, click ready!"

### 3. Game Start Broadcasting (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Game was starting for host but NOT for other players in room.

**Root Cause:** Used `socketio.emit()` instead of `emit()` with `broadcast=True`.

**Fix:** [web_app_multiplayer.py:512-515](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\web_app_multiplayer.py#L512-L515)

**Before:**
```python
socketio.emit('game_started', {
    'room_info': room_info_data
}, to=room_code)
```

**After:**
```python
emit('game_started', {
    'room_info': room_info_data
}, broadcast=True, to=room_code, include_self=True)
```

**Key Differences:**
- `socketio.emit()` - Global server emit, may not respect room membership correctly
- `emit()` - Context-aware emit from within event handler
- `broadcast=True` - Sends to all in room except sender
- `include_self=True` - Also sends to sender (host)

**Why This Matters:**
In Flask-SocketIO 5.x, when emitting from within an event handler (`@socketio.on`):
- Use `emit()` (not `socketio.emit()`)
- Add `broadcast=True` to send to others in room
- Add `include_self=True` to also send to sender
- Add `to=room_code` to specify the room

This ensures ALL players in the socket.io room receive the event.

## Testing

### Test 1: Name Input Styling

1. Join a room
2. Click in the "Enter new name" input box
3. **Verify:** White background (not purple)
4. **Verify:** Text is readable (black on white)
5. **Verify:** Input box aligned left (not shifted right)

### Test 2: Player Numbers

1. Browser 1: Create room without name → "Player 1"
2. Browser 2: Join without name → "Player 2"
3. Browser 2: Change name to "Alice"
4. **Verify:** Shows "Player 2: Alice" (keeps number)
5. Browser 3: Join without name → "Player 3"
6. Browser 3: Change name to "Bob"
7. **Verify:** Shows "Player 3: Bob"

**In all browsers, verify players can be identified by number**

### Test 3: Game Start (MOST IMPORTANT)

**Prerequisites:**
- Fresh server restart: `python web_app_multiplayer.py`
- Two browsers with console open (F12)

**Steps:**
1. Browser 1: Create room
2. Browser 2: Join room
3. Both click "Ready"
4. Host clicks "Start Game"

**Server Console Should Show:**
```
Broadcasting game_started to room TILE-XXXX
Players in room: ['session_abc', 'session_def']
Room info state: playing
Room info has tiles: True
Game started event broadcast complete
```

**Browser 1 Console:**
```
Game started event received!
Am I host? true
Host: Revealing tiles
```

**Browser 2 Console:**
```
Game started event received!
Am I host? false
Non-host: Loading graph with tiles
```

**Visual (BOTH browsers):**
- ✅ Lobby disappears
- ✅ Game canvas appears
- ✅ Identical tiles shown
- ✅ Leaderboard visible

**If Browser 2 doesn't receive event:**
- Server restart may be needed
- Check console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Flask-SocketIO version is 5.3.5

## Flask-SocketIO Broadcasting Patterns

### ❌ WRONG (What we had):
```python
@socketio.on('some_event')
def handler(data):
    socketio.emit('response', data, to=room_code)
```
**Problem:** May not broadcast to all room members correctly

### ✅ CORRECT (What we have now):
```python
@socketio.on('some_event')
def handler(data):
    emit('response', data, broadcast=True, to=room_code, include_self=True)
```
**Result:** Broadcasts to ALL room members including sender

### When to use which:

**Use `emit()` with `broadcast=True`:**
- Inside event handlers (`@socketio.on`)
- Need to send to room members
- Want sender to also receive

**Use `socketio.emit()`:**
- Outside event handlers
- Server-initiated broadcasts
- Background tasks

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Name Changes
```
Player 1                    Initial
Player 1: Alice             After change to "Alice"
Player 1: AliceTheBest      After change to "AliceTheBest"
```

### Game Start
```
Host clicks "Start Game"
  ↓
Server broadcasts with emit()
  ↓
ALL players receive event simultaneously
  ↓
ALL players see game board with identical tiles
  ↓
Game begins for everyone! ✓
```

**Status:** ✅ All three critical issues fixed

**Priority:** Test immediately - especially the game start fix!
