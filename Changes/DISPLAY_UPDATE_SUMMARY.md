# Display Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Node Cap at 20
**Implementation:** Maximum of 20 nodes enforced across all graph creation methods

**Location:** All three `GraphBuilder` methods
- `create_manually()` - Line 187-189
- `create_from_file()` - Line 239-241
- `create_random()` - Line 267-269

**Validation Messages:**
- Manual/File: "Graph has {n} nodes. Maximum 20 nodes allowed."
- Random: "Maximum 20 nodes allowed."

### 2. Display Logic Changes
**New Behavior:**
- **At game start (large graphs >10 nodes only):** Adjacency matrix shown once for reference
- **Before every move (all graphs):** Circular ASCII layout shown

**Previous Behavior:**
- Small graphs (≤10 nodes): Circular layout
- Large graphs (>10 nodes): Adjacency matrix

**Why This Is Better:**
- Players can always see the visual graph before making moves
- Adjacency matrix provides initial reference for complex graphs
- Circular layout is more intuitive for gameplay

### 3. Code Changes

#### GameDisplay Class
```python
# NEW: Separated methods
def display_visual_graph(self):
    """Always shows circular layout"""
    self._display_circular_layout()

def display_adjacency_matrix(self):
    """Shows adjacency matrix (called separately)"""
    self._display_adjacency_matrix()
```

**Previous:**
```python
def display_visual_graph(self):
    if num_nodes <= 10:
        self._display_circular_layout()
    else:
        self._display_adjacency_matrix()
```

#### TileSwapGame.play() Method
```python
# At game start (line 615-617)
if len(self.graph.get_nodes()) > 10:
    self.display.display_adjacency_matrix()  # Once for reference

# Before each move (line 630)
self.display.display_visual_graph()  # Always circular
```

## Test Results

### Test 1: Small Graph (5 nodes)
- ✓ Circular layout shown
- ✓ No adjacency matrix at start
- ✓ Circular layout before each move

### Test 2: Large Graph (15 nodes)
- ✓ Adjacency matrix shown at game start
- ✓ Circular layout shown before each move
- ✓ Both displays work correctly

### Test 3: Maximum Graph (20 nodes)
- ✓ Graph creation succeeds
- ✓ Circular layout displays all 20 nodes
- ✓ Layout remains readable

### Test 4: Node Cap Validation
- ✓ 20 nodes accepted
- ✓ 21+ nodes rejected with clear message
- ✓ Validation in all three creation methods

## Benefits

### For Players
1. **Always see visual graph before moves** - easier to plan strategy
2. **Circular layout is more intuitive** - better spatial understanding
3. **Adjacency matrix for reference** - available at start for complex graphs
4. **Reasonable graph size** - 20 nodes is manageable but still challenging

### For Performance
1. **Circular layout scales well** - tested up to 20 nodes
2. **No infinite loops** - capped at reasonable maximum
3. **Clear in terminal** - readable output for all sizes

### For Gameplay
1. **Better visual feedback** - see connections and tiles together
2. **Consistent interface** - same display type during play
3. **Reference available** - matrix at start for complex graphs

## File Updates

### Modified Files
- `tile_swap.py` - Main game file with all changes

### New Test Files
- `test_new_display_logic.py` - Tests display changes
- `test_node_cap.py` - Tests 20-node validation

### Documentation Updates
- This file (`DISPLAY_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`)

## Backward Compatibility

### What Changed
- Display logic for large graphs during gameplay
- Maximum node count enforced

### What Stayed the Same
- All game mechanics
- Circular layout algorithm
- Adjacency matrix algorithm
- File format
- User interface flow
- Scoring system

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. Make node cap configurable (environment variable or config file)
2. Add option to toggle between circular and matrix during game
3. Optimize circular layout algorithm for very dense graphs
4. Add color support for terminals that support it

### Known Limitations
1. Very dense 20-node graphs may have overlapping edges
2. Circular layout best for sparse to moderate density
3. Terminal width may affect display on some systems

## Conclusion

The updates successfully:
- ✓ Cap nodes at 20 for manageable gameplay
- ✓ Show circular layout before all moves
- ✓ Provide adjacency matrix reference at start (large graphs)
- ✓ Improve player experience with consistent visual feedback
- ✓ Maintain all existing functionality

All tests pass and the game is ready for play!
