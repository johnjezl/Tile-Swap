# Gameplay Flow Update - Adjacency Matrix Display

## Change Summary

The adjacency matrix is now **always displayed** after the player completes tile assignment, before gameplay begins.

## Previous Behavior

- Adjacency matrix only shown at game start for graphs with >10 nodes
- Small graphs never showed the adjacency matrix

## New Behavior

- **After Step 2 (Assign Tiles)**: Adjacency matrix is displayed for ALL graph sizes
- **Before Step 3 (Gameplay)**: Matrix serves as reference for the player

## Updated Game Flow

```
STEP 1: Create Graph
├── Manual entry / File load / Random generation
└── Display graph structure (text)

STEP 2: Assign Tiles
├── Manual assignment / Random assignment
└── [NEW] Display adjacency matrix for reference
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ TILE ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE            │
    │ Adjacency Matrix with Tiles:        │
    │   Shows all connections + tile pos  │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 3: Gameplay
├── Display current tile positions
├── Show score and optimal solution
└── Game loop:
    ├── Show circular visual graph
    ├── Player enters move
    ├── Update tiles
    └── Repeat until solved
```

## Display Timing

### At Game Start (After Tile Assignment)
```
==================================================
TILE ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE
==================================================

Adjacency Matrix with Tiles:
================================================================================
        1: 3 !  2: 1 !  3: 4 !  4: 2 !
 1: 3 !    �     1     1     1
 2: 1 !    1     �     1     0
 3: 4 !    1     1     �     1
 4: 2 !    1     0     1     �
================================================================================
Legend: Node:Tile= (= matched, ! not matched), 1=connected, 0=not connected
```

### During Gameplay (Before Each Move)
```
--------------------------------------------------

Visual Graph Representation:
============================================================
          [1:3!]
            \|\
           \ | \
          \  |  \
  [4:2!]     |    [2:1!]
          \  |  \
           \ | \
            \|\
          [3:4!]
============================================================
Legend: [Node:Tile=] (= means matched, ! means not matched)

Enter two connected nodes to swap their tiles (node1 node2):
```

## Benefits

### 1. Better Planning
- Players can study the full graph structure before starting
- See both connections (adjacency) and tile positions together
- Helps identify optimal move sequences

### 2. Reference Material
- Matrix shown once at the beginning
- Players can scroll back to see it during gameplay
- No need to repeatedly show it (reduces clutter)

### 3. Consistent Experience
- All graph sizes get the same treatment
- No arbitrary 10-node cutoff for matrix display
- Small and large graphs both show comprehensive information

### 4. Educational Value
- Demonstrates adjacency matrix representation
- Shows relationship between visual graph and matrix
- Good for CS students learning graph theory

## Code Changes

### File: `tile_swap_game.py`

**In `setup_tiles()` method (after line 89):**
```python
# Display adjacency matrix after tiles are assigned
print("\n" + "="*50)
print("TILE ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE")
print("="*50)
self.display.display_adjacency_matrix()
```

**In `play()` method (removed lines 101-103):**
```python
# REMOVED: Conditional adjacency matrix display
# if len(self.graph.get_nodes()) > 10:
#     self.display.display_adjacency_matrix()
```

## Testing

Run `test_adjacency_display.py` to verify the new behavior:
```bash
python test_adjacency_display.py
```

## User Experience

### Before (Large Graphs Only)
```
STEP 2: Assign Tiles → Done
TILE SWAP - GAME START
[Adjacency Matrix shown here - only if >10 nodes]
Current Score: 0
```

### After (All Graphs)
```
STEP 2: Assign Tiles → Done
==================================================
TILE ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE
==================================================
[Adjacency Matrix shown here - ALWAYS]

TILE SWAP - GAME START
Current Score: 0
```

## Summary

✓ Adjacency matrix now displayed after tile assignment for all graphs
✓ Provides clear transition between setup and gameplay
✓ Gives players reference information before they start
✓ Maintains circular visual graph display during gameplay

The change enhances player experience by providing comprehensive graph information at the optimal time - right after setup, before the challenge begins.
