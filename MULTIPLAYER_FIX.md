# Multiplayer Synchronization Fix

## Issue
Players in multiplayer mode were getting different starting tile configurations, making the competition unfair.

## Root Cause
When non-host players joined a room and the game started, they would:
1. Receive the graph structure (edges) from the host
2. Call `/api/custom_game` which would create the graph correctly
3. BUT then call `assign_tiles_randomly()` which gave each player a different random starting position

## Solution

### Changes Made

1. **New API Endpoint** ([web_app_multiplayer.py:109-131](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\web_app_multiplayer.py#L109-L131))
   - Added `/api/custom_game_with_tiles` endpoint
   - Accepts both `edges` and `tiles` parameters
   - Sets exact tile configuration instead of randomizing

2. **Client-Side Update** ([multiplayer.js:392-420](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\static\multiplayer.js#L392-L420))
   - Modified `loadMultiplayerGraph()` to use new endpoint
   - Now sends both edges AND tiles to server
   - Added debug logging to verify tile synchronization

3. **Server-Side Logging** ([web_app_multiplayer.py:427](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\web_app_multiplayer.py#L427))
   - Added logging when game starts to show initial tile configuration
   - Helps verify all players receive same configuration

## Data Flow

### Before Fix
```
Host creates graph → Random tiles (A)
Host starts game   → Broadcasts edges only
Player 1 receives  → Creates graph → Random tiles (B) ❌ Different!
Player 2 receives  → Creates graph → Random tiles (C) ❌ Different!
```

### After Fix
```
Host creates graph → Random tiles (A)
Host starts game   → Broadcasts edges + tiles (A)
Player 1 receives  → Creates graph → Uses tiles (A) ✓ Same!
Player 2 receives  → Creates graph → Uses tiles (A) ✓ Same!
```

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Start server: `python web_app_multiplayer.py`
2. Open two browser windows (use incognito for second)
3. Window 1: Create room, mark ready
4. Window 2: Join room with code, mark ready
5. Window 1: Start game
6. Check browser console logs: Both should show identical `tiles` object
7. Verify both windows show same colored tiles on same nodes

### Expected Console Output

**Host browser:**
```
Connected to server: abc123
```

**Non-host browser:**
```
Connected to server: def456
Loading multiplayer graph with tiles: {0: 0, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 2, ...}
Multiplayer graph loaded. Tiles: {0: 0, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 2, ...}
```

**Server console:**
```
Starting game in room TILE-A1B2 with tiles: {0: 0, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 2, ...}
```

All three should show **identical tile mappings**.

## Implementation Details

### Room Info Structure
The `get_room_info()` method in `GameRoom` ([multiplayer.py:183-196](h:\My Drive\CS 415 - Algorithm Analysis\Tile Swap\multiplayer.py#L183-L196)) includes:
```python
{
    'code': 'TILE-XXXX',
    'mode': 'realtime' or 'turnbased',
    'graph_edges': [(0,1), (1,2), ...],      # Same for all
    'initial_tiles': {0: 2, 1: 0, 2: 1, ...}, # Same for all
    ...
}
```

### Tile Format
Tiles are stored as a dictionary mapping node numbers to tile values:
- `{0: 2, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 3}` means:
  - Node 0 has tile 2
  - Node 1 has tile 0
  - Node 2 has tile 1
  - Node 3 has tile 3

The goal is to swap tiles until each node's number matches its tile value (solved state).

## Backward Compatibility

The original `/api/custom_game` endpoint remains unchanged:
- Still used for single-player mode
- Still generates random tiles
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

Only multiplayer mode uses the new `/api/custom_game_with_tiles` endpoint.

## Files Modified

1. `web_app_multiplayer.py` - Added new API endpoint + logging
2. `static/multiplayer.js` - Updated to send tiles with graph data
3. `MULTIPLAYER_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Status

✅ **Fixed** - All players now receive identical starting configurations for fair competition.
