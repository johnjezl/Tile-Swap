## First Game (5-Minute Tutorial)

### Step 1: Create a Random Game

1. Look at the left panel under "Game Setup"
2. Set "Number of Nodes" to **6** (default)
3. Click **"New Random Game"**
4. A graph with 6 nodes appears on the canvas

### Step 2: Understand the Display

**Node Colors:**
- **Green** = Tile matches node number (goal!)
- **Blue** = Tile doesn't match (needs swapping)

**Node Labels:**
- Top text = Node number
- Bottom number = Current tile number

**Goal:** Make all nodes green by swapping tiles!

### Step 3: Make Your First Move

1. Click on any blue node (it gets a yellow outline)
2. Click on a connected blue node
3. Watch the tiles smoothly animate as they swap!
4. The move counter increases

### Step 4: Use Undo if Needed

Made a mistake? Click the **‚Ü∂ Undo** button to reverse your last move.

Want to try again? Click **‚Ü∑ Redo** to reapply it.

### Step 5: Solve the Puzzle

Keep swapping until all nodes are green!

When you win:
- A victory message appears
- Victory music plays
- Your score is compared to the optimal solution

## Tips for Success

### Strategy Tips

1. **Plan ahead** - Look at the entire graph before making moves
2. **Focus on cycles** - Tiles often form circular patterns
3. **Use undo liberally** - Experiment without fear!
4. **Check the optimal count** - Try to beat or match it

### Graph Editor Tips

1. **Start simple** - Try a triangle (3 nodes, 3 edges) first
2. **Make it connected** - Every node must have at least one edge
3. **More edges = easier** - More swap options available
4. **Fewer edges = harder** - More constrained puzzle

### Interface Tips

1. **Use keyboard shortcuts** - Much faster than clicking
2. **Save interesting graphs** - Reuse them later
3. **Try dark mode** - Better for long sessions
4. **Watch the animations** - They help visualize the swaps

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect to server"

Make sure the Flask server is running:
```bash
python web_app.py
```

### Port 5000 already in use

Edit `web_app.py` and change the port:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080

### Sound doesn't work

- Check your browser supports Web Audio API (all modern browsers do)
- Make sure "Sound Effects" is checked
- Check your system volume

### Dark mode doesn't persist

Make sure your browser allows localStorage:
- Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Cookies (allow all)
- Firefox: Options ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Cookies (standard)

### Save/load doesn't work

- Make sure pop-ups are allowed
- Check file permissions in your browser
- Try downloading to a different folder
