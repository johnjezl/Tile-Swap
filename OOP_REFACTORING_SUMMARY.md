# Tile Swap - OOP Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The original `graph_tile_game.py` has been completely restructured into a fully object-oriented design with the new name **Tile Swap** reflected throughout.

## File Changes

### New Files
- **`tile_swap.py`** - Main game file (fully OOP)
- **`TILE_SWAP_README.md`** - Updated documentation
- **`test_oop_structure.py`** - OOP structure validation tests
- **`OOP_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

### Original Files (Preserved)
- `graph_tile_game.py` - Original procedural version
- `README.md` - Original documentation

## Object-Oriented Design

### Class Architecture

```
TileSwapGame (controller)
├── Graph (data structure)
├── TileManager (tile operations)
├── GameDisplay (visualization)
├── ScoreCalculator (static utility)
└── GraphBuilder (static factory)
```

### Class Responsibilities

#### 1. **Graph** (Data Structure)
- **Purpose**: Represents the undirected connected graph
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage adjacency list
  - Store tile assignments
  - Check connectivity (BFS)
  - Validate node existence and connections
- **Key Methods**:
  - `add_edge(node1, node2)`
  - `get_nodes()` → sorted list
  - `get_neighbors(node)` → set of neighbors
  - `is_connected()` → boolean
  - `has_node(node)` → boolean
  - `are_connected(node1, node2)` → boolean

#### 2. **TileManager** (Business Logic)
- **Purpose**: Handles all tile-related operations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Assign tiles (manual/random)
  - Swap tiles between nodes
  - Check solution state
  - Track tile configuration
- **Key Methods**:
  - `assign_tiles(tile_assignment)`
  - `assign_tiles_manually()` → boolean
  - `assign_tiles_randomly()`
  - `swap_tiles(node1, node2)`
  - `is_solved()` → boolean
  - `get_initial_configuration()` → dict

#### 3. **GraphBuilder** (Factory Pattern)
- **Purpose**: Creates graphs from various sources
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manual graph creation (interactive)
  - File-based graph loading
  - Random graph generation
  - Input validation
- **Static Methods**:
  - `create_manually()` → Graph or None
  - `create_from_file()` → Graph or None
  - `create_random()` → Graph or None

#### 4. **GameDisplay** (Presentation Layer)
- **Purpose**: Manages all visualization and UI output
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Display graph structure (text)
  - Display tile assignments
  - ASCII art visualization (circular/matrix)
  - Bresenham's line drawing algorithm
- **Key Methods**:
  - `display_graph_structure()`
  - `display_tiles()`
  - `display_visual_graph()`
  - `_display_circular_layout()` (private)
  - `_display_adjacency_matrix()` (private)
  - `_draw_line(grid, x1, y1, x2, y2)` (private)

#### 5. **ScoreCalculator** (Utility)
- **Purpose**: Computes optimal solutions
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Calculate minimum swaps using cycle decomposition
  - Analyze permutation cycles
- **Static Method**:
  - `calculate_optimal_moves(tile_configuration)` → int

#### 6. **TileSwapGame** (Controller/Orchestrator)
- **Purpose**: Main game controller that orchestrates gameplay
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage game state and flow
  - Coordinate between classes
  - Handle user input for moves
  - Display victory conditions
- **Key Methods**:
  - `setup_graph()` → boolean
  - `setup_tiles()` → boolean
  - `play()` (main game loop)
  - `run()` (full session with replay)
  - `_process_move(user_input)` → boolean (private)
  - `_display_victory()` (private)

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
Each class has one clear purpose:
- `Graph`: Data structure only
- `TileManager`: Tile operations only
- `GameDisplay`: Visualization only
- `GraphBuilder`: Graph creation only
- `ScoreCalculator`: Optimal solution calculation only
- `TileSwapGame`: Game flow orchestration only

### 2. **Encapsulation**
- Private methods prefixed with `_` (Python convention)
- Internal state accessed through public methods
- Graph tiles accessed through TileManager

### 3. **Composition Over Inheritance**
- `TileSwapGame` composes other classes rather than inheriting
- Loose coupling between components
- Easy to test individual classes

### 4. **Factory Pattern**
- `GraphBuilder` uses static factory methods
- Centralizes graph creation logic
- Easy to add new creation methods

### 5. **Separation of Concerns**
- Business logic (TileManager) separate from presentation (GameDisplay)
- Data structure (Graph) independent of operations
- Game flow (TileSwapGame) separate from calculations (ScoreCalculator)

## Code Comparison

### Before (Procedural)
```python
# Functions scattered throughout file
def create_graph_manually():
    graph = Graph()
    # ... 50 lines of code
    return graph

def play_game(graph, initial_tiles):
    # ... 80 lines of code

# Many global functions
```

### After (OOP)
```python
# Clear class structure
class TileSwapGame:
    def setup_graph(self):
        self.graph = GraphBuilder.create_manually()

    def play(self):
        # Orchestrates other classes
        self.display.display_visual_graph()

# Entry point
game = TileSwapGame()
game.run()
```

## Benefits of OOP Refactoring

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Changes to visualization don't affect game logic
- Easy to modify tile operations without touching graph structure
- Clear boundaries between components

### 2. **Testability**
- Each class can be tested independently
- Mock objects can replace dependencies
- Unit tests are straightforward

### 3. **Extensibility**
- Add new graph builders easily (e.g., from JSON)
- Create new display modes without touching other code
- Add new scoring algorithms independently

### 4. **Readability**
- Clear class names indicate purpose
- Methods are shorter and focused
- Game flow is easier to follow

### 5. **Reusability**
- `Graph` class can be used in other projects
- `ScoreCalculator` is a standalone utility
- `GameDisplay` could work with different games

## Testing

All classes have been validated with `test_oop_structure.py`:

```
[OK] Graph class working
[OK] TileManager class working
[OK] GameDisplay class working
[OK] ScoreCalculator class working
[OK] GraphBuilder class structure correct
[OK] TileSwapGame class structure correct
```

## Lines of Code Comparison

### Original (graph_tile_game.py)
- Total: ~650 lines
- Procedural functions: ~15
- Single Graph class: ~150 lines

### Refactored (tile_swap.py)
- Total: ~650 lines (similar)
- Classes: 6 well-defined classes
- Average class size: ~100 lines
- Better organized and maintainable

## Running the Game

### Original Version
```bash
python graph_tile_game.py
```

### OOP Version (Tile Swap)
```bash
python tile_swap.py
```

Both versions have identical functionality, but the OOP version is:
- More maintainable
- Better organized
- Easier to extend
- More testable
- Professional grade code

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully transforms a procedural game into a fully object-oriented application while:
- ✓ Maintaining all original functionality
- ✓ Improving code organization
- ✓ Following OOP best practices
- ✓ Using meaningful names throughout
- ✓ Reflecting the "Tile Swap" branding
- ✓ Making the codebase more professional and maintainable

The new structure is suitable for:
- Academic submission (demonstrates OOP mastery)
- Portfolio projects (shows design skills)
- Future enhancements (easy to extend)
- Team collaboration (clear boundaries)
